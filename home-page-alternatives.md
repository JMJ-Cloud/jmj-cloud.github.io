**Tagline:** "Enterprise Oracle. Modern Speed."

## "What We Do" Section Alternatives

### Current Format: Bullet List
The current page uses 6 capability items with bold headers.

### Alternative A: Condensed 3-Pillar Approach
Instead of 6 bullets, consolidate into 3 clear pillars:

1. **Build** — Custom APEX apps, extensions, mobile solutions, and AI-powered workflows
2. **Integrate** — OIC, REST/SOAP APIs, real-time data flows between Oracle and third-party systems
3. **Optimize** — Cloud migrations, performance tuning, reporting, and ongoing support

### Alternative B: Outcome-Focused Statements
Replace technical descriptions with outcomes:

- **Accelerate implementation** — Get to production faster with agile sprints
- **Extend without limits** — Custom apps and integrations that Oracle can't provide out-of-box
- **Future-proof investments** — Clean architecture that scales as you grow
- **Reduce manual work** — Automation that eliminates spreadsheets and data entry

### Alternative C: Question-Based Format
- **Need a custom APEX app?** We build user-facing tools your team will actually use.
- **Stuck on integrations?** OIC, REST APIs, SOAP—we connect Oracle to anything.
- **Planning a cloud migration?** We handle EBS-to-Cloud coexistence and data moves.

## Service Card Alternatives

### Current Cards
1. Oracle ERP Cloud
2. Oracle APEX & ORDS
3. E-Business Suite

### Alternative: Add a 4th Card
Consider adding **Integration & Automation** as a fourth service to highlight OIC expertise:

| Card | Title | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 4 | **Oracle Integration Cloud** | "Connect Oracle to third-party systems with OIC flows, REST APIs, and event-driven integrations." |

### Alternative: Rename for Clarity
- "Oracle ERP Cloud" → "**Cloud ERP Implementation**"
- "Oracle APEX & ORDS" → "**Custom Applications**"
- "E-Business Suite" → "**EBS Modernization**"

---

## CTA Button Alternatives

### Current
- Primary: "View Our Work"
- Secondary: "Get in Touch"

### Alternative Options

| Primary | Secondary |
|---------|-----------|
| "See Our Projects" | "Start a Conversation" |
| "Explore Case Studies" | "Schedule a Call" |
| "View Portfolio" | "Let's Talk" |
| "See What We've Built" | "Request a Consultation" |

---

## "Latest Projects" Section Alternatives

### Alternative Title Options
- "Recent Client Work"
- "Featured Projects"
- "Case Studies"
- "What We've Delivered"
- "Success Stories"

### Alternative: Add Social Proof
Consider adding a brief testimonial or metric above the projects:

> "JMJ Cloud has delivered 50+ Oracle solutions across hospitality, manufacturing, and financial services."

---

## Layout/Structure Suggestions

### Suggestion 1: Add a "Why JMJ Cloud" Section
Before the services section, add a brief differentiation block:

> **Why JMJ Cloud?**
> - Austin-based team with 20+ years Oracle experience
> - Agile delivery model (2-week sprints)
> - Specializing in Oracle APEX, OIC, and ERP Cloud

### Suggestion 2: Add Client Logos
If you have permission, adding a "Trusted By" logo strip builds credibility quickly.

### Suggestion 3: Move Projects Above Services
Many B2B sites show proof (projects) before explaining capabilities. Consider testing this order:
1. Hero
2. Latest Projects
3. What We Do
4. Service Cards

---

## Summary: Quick Wins

If you want to make minimal changes with maximum impact, consider:

1. **Tagline refresh:** "Oracle Expertise. Delivered Fast." (clearer than "Enterprise Oracle. Modern Speed.")

2. **Hero description tightening:**
   Current: 47 words
   Suggested: "We build and extend Oracle ERP Cloud, APEX, and E-Business Suite solutions—shipped in agile sprints, not waterfall releases. APEX apps, OIC integrations, mobile experiences, and AI automation."

3. **CTA update:** Change "Get in Touch" to "Schedule a Call" (more specific action)
