- Customer portal for order tracking and account management

### Progressive Web App (PWA) Features

## Technical Approach

### Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS)
- RESTful APIs exposing E-Business Suite data and transactions
- Secure authentication using OAuth 2.0
- Rate limiting and API management

### Modern UI/UX
- Responsive design supporting desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- Dark mode support
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)

## Current Status

This ongoing initiative continues to expand with new modules and features being added each sprint. Our team is working to replace legacy Oracle Forms screens with modern APEX alternatives.
