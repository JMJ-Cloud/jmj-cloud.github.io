## Project Overview

JMJ Cloud implemented Oracle Cloud Project Portfolio Management (PPM) for a major university system, enabling comprehensive grants management and project costing capabilities. This implementation supports research operations across multiple campuses managing over $200 million in sponsored research funding.

## Business Drivers

The university faced challenges with their legacy project accounting system:
- Manual tracking of grant budgets and expenditures
- Difficulty complying with federal grant reporting requirements
- Limited visibility into project financial status
- Complex allocation rules for indirect costs
- Siloed data between research administration and finance

## Solution Scope

- **Project Financial Management** - Project accounting, budgeting, and costing
- **Grants Management** - Award lifecycle from proposal through closeout
- **Project Costing** - Labor, expense, and subcontract cost tracking
- **Project Billing** - Cost reimbursement billing to sponsors

### Key Functional Areas

#### Award Management
- Award setup with sponsor terms and conditions
- Budget creation aligned with sponsor-approved amounts
