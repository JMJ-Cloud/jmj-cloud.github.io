## Introduction

"Eating your own dog food" is a common expression in the software industry, meaning you use the products you build or sell. At JMJ Cloud, we practice what we preach by running our internal business operations on Oracle APEX.

## Why Eat Our Own Dog Food?

Using APEX internally provides several benefits:

1. **Deep Product Knowledge**: Daily use keeps our skills sharp
2. **Real-World Testing**: We discover issues before our clients do
3. **Feature Exploration**: We try new features in a safe environment
4. **Credibility**: We can speak from experience with clients
