I recently attended ODTUG KSCOPE 2018 and wanted to share the key takeaways from the conference. KSCOPE continues to be an excellent event with a strong APEX and ORDS community presence.

## Introducing the Oracle RAD Stack

The Oracle development team introduced the RAD Stack, defined as "an inclusive technology stack based on three core components: Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS), Oracle APEX, and Oracle Database."

While this combines existing technologies, the new branding provides marketing appeal and positions these tools as a cohesive solution rather than separate products.

## APEX Automation

Automation was a major theme covering three areas:

### Testing

The APEX Test Automation Framework (ATAF) uses metadata to generate Selenium test scripts. These scripts can be deployed to cloud-based grids for parallel execution, enabling comprehensive testing without manual script maintenance.

### Continuous Integration

Jenkins pipelines provide automation for the build, test, and deployment lifecycle. The community is embracing CI/CD practices that are standard in other development ecosystems.

### Low Code

Application Blueprints enable rapid app creation from data models. Combined with Quick SQL for rapid data model creation, developers can go from idea to working application faster than ever.

## Mobile Features

APEX 18.1 includes several mobile enhancements:

- **Swipe gestures**: Navigate between pages with natural touch interactions
- **Mobile tabbed menus**: Native-feeling navigation patterns
- **Sticky buttons**: Actions that remain visible as users scroll
- **Responsive Universal Theme**: Improved support for Progressive Web Applications (PWAs)

These features help APEX applications feel more native on mobile devices without requiring custom development.

## Oracle Database 18c XE

The announcement of Oracle Database 18c XE was exciting. This free edition promises:

- All Enterprise Edition features
- 1 CPU limit
- 2GB RAM limit
- 12GB disk limit
- Support for 4 pluggable databases

This enables developers to replicate production environments locally for development and testing - something that was previously costly or impossible.

## Additional Highlights

Several other announcements caught my attention:

- **Exadata Express migration**: Pathway to Autonomous Database for existing customers
- **CDN hosting**: Static files can be served from Content Delivery Networks for improved performance
- **APEX MOOC**: Massive Open Online Course planned for APEX training
- **APEX certifications**: Official certification programs in development
- **Near-zero downtime upgrades**: Improved upgrade experience for production systems

## Conclusion

KSCOPE 2018 reinforced that APEX and ORDS continue to evolve rapidly. The introduction of the RAD Stack branding, combined with automation improvements and mobile features, positions these tools for broader adoption.

The Oracle Database 18c XE announcement is particularly significant for the developer community - having access to enterprise features in a free edition removes barriers to adoption and learning.

If you haven't attended KSCOPE, I highly recommend it. The community is welcoming, the content is practical, and the networking opportunities are invaluable.
