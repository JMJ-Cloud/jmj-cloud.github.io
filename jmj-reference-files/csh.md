# Customer Service Hub

A unified platform transforming how a multi-plant manufacturing enterprise manages customer relationships, sales activities, and service delivery.

---

## The Challenge

Fragmented customer data across multiple systems created blind spots in service delivery.

### Disconnected Systems
Customer information scattered across Oracle EBS modules, spreadsheets, and legacy applications with no single source of truth.

### Lost Sales Opportunities
No visibility into customer interactions, quote history, or sales activities meant leads fell through the cracks and relationships suffered.

### Multi-Plant Complexity
Sales teams needed plant-specific data while maintaining enterprise-wide customer views—a balance existing tools couldn't achieve.

---

## The Solution

A purpose-built Oracle APEX application tightly integrated with E-Business Suite.

### Unified Customer Master
Real-time views of customer accounts, sites, contacts, and agreements directly from Oracle EBS—eliminating data duplication and ensuring consistency across all touchpoints.

### Sales Activity Tracking
Complete history of every customer interaction, meeting, and communication. Sales teams capture activities in real-time, building institutional knowledge that persists beyond individual tenure.

### Quote Management
End-to-end quote lifecycle from lead capture through proposal delivery. Headers, line items, terms & conditions, and attachments managed in a streamlined workflow integrated with pricing data.

### Credit & Terms Intelligence
Live credit limit visibility, historical terms reporting, and AR aging analysis. Empower sales and service teams to make informed decisions with complete financial context.
