# What We Do

We help organizations get more value out of Oracle by modernizing, integrating, and supporting the systems that run their business—**from Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) to Oracle ERP Cloud**. Whether you’re optimizing what you have, migrating to the cloud, or running a hybrid environment, we deliver practical, secure solutions in fast, iterative sprints—and carry them all the way to production with testing, deployments, and ongoing support.

We also extend Oracle into the hands of your teams with **enterprise-grade iOS/mobile apps** and **AI-enabled workflows** that reduce manual effort, speed decisions, and improve data quality—without compromising security or governance.

## Core capabilities

- **Oracle ERP expertise (Cloud + EBS):** implementations, enhancements, upgrades, integrations, and ongoing support for hybrid and cloud-first environments  
- **Build & enhance Oracle solutions:** custom extensions, workflow automation, APEX/ORDS apps, and user-facing tools  
- **Integrate everything:** OIC, APIs (REST/SOAP), event-driven integrations, EDI, and end-to-end data flows between Oracle and third-party platforms  
- **Enterprise mobile (iOS & cross-platform):** secure, scalable mobile apps for approvals, field operations, inventory, service, and executive dashboards—built with SSO, role-based access, offline support, and enterprise security standards  
- **AI to increase productivity:** copilots and intelligent assistants, document summarization, knowledge search across Oracle data, automated ticket triage, anomaly detection, and “next-best action” recommendations—built with guardrails, auditability, and human-in-the-loop controls  
- **Modernize & migrate:** cloud adoption, EBS-to-Cloud roadmaps, performance tuning, and technical debt reduction  
- **Reporting & analytics:** automated extracts, dashboards, and actionable reporting for finance and operations  
- **Run & support:** steady-state support, troubleshooting, release management, and production deployments
